To create a research application that tests everything possible (permitted) operations (arithmetic, relational (comparisons), logical, bitwise (binary), 
assignment operations and other operations) over the permitted data types of the Java programming language (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean). Also
it tests two reference types - String and Student (created by author).
